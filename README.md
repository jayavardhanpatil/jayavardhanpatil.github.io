# Jayavardhan Patil - Personal Website

⚠️ **SITE IS NOT LIVE YET** - GitHub Pages needs to be enabled in repository settings. See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for instructions.

This is my personal website hosted on GitHub Pages.

## 🚀 Quick Start - Make This Site Live

**The site is not live because GitHub Pages is not enabled.** To fix this:

1. Go to [Repository Settings](https://github.com/jayavardhanpatil/jayavardhanpatil.github.io/settings/pages)
2. Under **Build and deployment** → **Source**:
   - **Option A (Recommended)**: Select "GitHub Actions"
   - **Option B (Simpler)**: Select "Deploy from a branch", choose "main" and "/ (root)"
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
4. Visit [https://jayavardhanpatil.github.io](https://jayavardhanpatil.github.io)
